# Suicide_rates_project
Final module project for PSY6422
This Project aimed to explore the question of "how have European rates of suicide changed since the Millennium?". The original dataset found examined this data globally however was then filtered to only include countries in Europe for a more detailed scope on the current trends and for the sake of a cleaner and more  topical visualisation. 
All information regarding the dataset can be found in the uploaded codebook, as well as in the data origins section of the HTML output. 

The Data and website from which is was sourced can be found using this link :

However the dataset will have to be filtered by the user to include the desired metrics.

No Statistical analysis of this data was conducted, however visual inspection of the graphs created identify a surprising trend of decreasing suicide rates over time in the countries with the highest initial rate of suicide per 100,000 population - whilst the remaining majority of European countries maintained a slightly fluctuating but mostly steady rate of suicide between 2000-2019. The motivation for such a question being that, with changing attitudes towards mental health in the last 2 decades and increasing education, how would this affect the rate of suicide. So with the negative trend inferred it could be interesting to explore this further to identify a cause and effect.
